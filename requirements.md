# 'a-maze-ing' software requirements

## Scope:
* What will your product do?
  * Base:
    * Will accept maze inputs and return maze solutions.
    * Will return maze solutions, images, and algorithm metadata.
  * Stretch:
    * Will return videos of how solution was reached.
    * Will allow user to change solving algorithm and algorithm parameters.
    * Will allow the user to generate new mazes.
    
* What will your product not do?
  * Will only solve 2d mazes.
  * Will not contain obstacles or prizes.
  * Will not contain a score element outside of distance or time.
  * Will not allow the user to directly contribute to solution.

## Functional Requirements:
* Base:
  * Will allow user to input unsolved maze.
  * Will return to user solution, if found, and metadata about maze solving algorithm.
* Stretch:
  * Will allow user to change algorithm and algorithm parameters of the maze solver.
  * Will return to user video of how solution was reached.
  * Will allow the user to generate new mazes.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
* The application will be accessible via GitHub.
* The application will be compatible with computers running Mac, Windows, or Linux.
* The application will contain unit-tests that can measure its functionality.
* The application will come with requirements for all additional software required for functionality.
* The application will be usable through the clients computer terminal.
